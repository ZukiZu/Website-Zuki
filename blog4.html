                <h1>Digital Divide Widens</h1>
            <p> 
                School closures caused by the Covid-19 outbreak have impacted over 1.5 billion pupils worldwide. Most schools have turned to e-learning in the face of this unparalleled educational disruption. Not all youngsters, however, have been able to complete their education via the internet. According to UNESCO, half of all pupils who are presently out of school, or nearly 830 million people, do not have access to a computer. Platforms designed for usage on basic mobile phones, such as Funzi and Ubongo, have been one answer for African families. However, in addition to the challenges of using mobile phones for studying, 40% of kids have no access to the Internet at home.
            </br></br>
            The digital gap is making it more difficult for educators to maintain learning continuity. It also has the potential to worsen existing disparities, as lack of access disproportionately affects the poor.In low-income nations, disparities are particularly pronounced, with 82 percent of students in Sub-Saharan Africa unable to use the internet. Girls are also disproportionately affected. They are the people who are least likely to have access to technology around the world. Children from low-income families are disproportionately affected by the digital divide in high-income countries. Even in the United States, nearly one-fifth of kids in kindergarten through 12th grade do not have access to computers or Internet connections that are fast enough. The bulk of these are from low-income families or ethnic minorities.
        </br></br>
        Above I briefly summarised the Digital Divide Widens reading. What I have to say is that even though technology is so progressive and playing a huge part in the world it is also disadvantaging other parts of the world. Covid-19 highlighted the issue of how technology has disadvantaged many people around the world. Especially students, mostly students that reside in Africa are disadvantaged as they do not have access to basic technology such as smartphones and the internet. I believe that if the world is planning on making technology takeover, governments should at least try providing students devices to help them further their education. If technology is going to be enforced on people that the people enforcing should make an effort in meeting people halfway. For example, making sure that rural areas have network and internet access. 
    </br></br>
    Another point I have is that I almost feel like technology is a money-making scheme because it is highly priced, to get access to the internet one has to buy data which is expensive and smartphones and laptops are also highly priced. This gives people in the middle class and above an advantage because they can afford. For people in the lower class, it is another story, technology to them is a luxury and even worse it is a luxury that is forced upon them. So, in order for disadvantaged people to access school material or work material they need to purchase a smart device.

To quote Eugene Owusu from Ethiopia, “Innovation does not happen by chance or in a vacuum. Innovation can not be legislated; it takes deliberate policy actions, enablers, positive incentives and entrepreneurship to make it happen”, (African Development Bank, 2019).
