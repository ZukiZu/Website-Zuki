               <h4>Explanation </h4> 
             As seen on the image on the left the logo icon and name of the website are found at the top.
             At the bottom of the logo is where the navigation bar is. The homepage background as annotated is animated. An image is to be inserted on the left of the homepage and a section of text to be inserted on the left of the homepage. The text is basically the intro of the website. As annotated an estimate of the size of the picture of box of the text were put (450x250). A scroll to top and bottom button is to be inserted to direct readers to next or previous section. 
             The second section as seen on the left consists of two boxes containing images. Images are indicated by the two shaded in triangles. This section is for the blog posts. Each box is to contain a single blog post. The image is to be positioned to the top of the box and below it should be the text. The boxes are to be symmetrical, equal in size. A scroll to top and bottom button is to be inserted to direct readers to next or previous section.
             The following section is to be as the same as above. The last section is for the footer or a quote.

             The colours to be used are to be brown, orange, blue, The colours are indicated on the image on the left by their codes (#CD853F, #DEB887, #87CEEB). Orange was chosen because it is bright and vibrant. Blue was chosen for its calming nature. The colours together were chosen in order to have a earthy theme as orange represents the sun, blue the water and the sky and so on.

             <h4>Changes made to final</h4>
             The final website created is different from the wireframe. Starting with the homepage, the navigation is to the side of the title and logo icon. The change was made because of the background image. The blog section is similar to the one planned however an extra box was added making them 3 instead of 2. The last section which is the footer stayed the same. Another part that was changed was the colours, instead of using brown, orange and blue, black and white were used however there are still are few hints of blue in the website.
              Black was chosen as it is basic and bold, used as the background as to not distract the readers with colours and instead focus on the writing. White was chosen as it is basic and quite clean, it is easier to read text that is in white if it is on a black background. White text becomes brighter on a black background. The initial plan was to put blue text however the blue did not quite read well. Black and white complement each other quite fairly.

                <h4> UX and UI</h4>
                 I believe that there is readability and legibility, I used the simplest fonts such as Times New Roman in order for text to be readable. I made the headings 
                 With the blog posts I made them to center in the page, they are aligned in the center. The margins of the right side of the page are straight causing each line to be aligned. I did this because I thought it would be much easier to read centered aligned text. I used simple colours such as black and white, I believed that other colours would distract a reader, however, there is a bit of colour in the homepage and there were coloured pictures added to somewhat balance out the black and whiteness of the website.
                 Navigation links are in a pink colour, this is done for users to easily see the “buttons” as the background and text is in black and white.
