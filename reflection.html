                <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p> 
                The first two weeks of the process I was a bit ambiguous. The main idea I wanted was having an animated background for my homepage. I was able to input the animated background but could not put text over the background. I asked for help and Andre advised that I use “z-index” ; z-index is used to specify the order of the element. What I then did was put a z-index of -1 on the image in order for it to go behind the text. However, I later on changed my mind on having an animated background.
            </br></br>As I was going through the tutorials on Ulwazi, in one of them it how to insert an icon on your website. An icon is a symbol that is put in web browsers on the tab of the website. For some reason I thought it was cool, it was just exciting to learn how to create a website from scratch.
            </br></br> I somewhat feel like with the way the code is structured I could have maybe found simpler ways of doing it such as finding another way to add space under text instead of using "br" tags. With the things I did not quite understand I would go to YouTube to better understand. With the blog sections I am not entirely satisfied about them. The information is fine, the problem is the layout of the blog, I could have added pictures or made it more appealing. However, at the moment I think it is fine.
           </br></br>The spacing, font and size of text I chose changed throughout the process. It was a bit difficult to figure out what would be comfortable for other readers. I believe the main reason for that was because I was creating the website from my point of view and not of the readers. So, what I would do is put font and sizing that I am comfortable with reading. Towards the end I realised that I should change the size of the text to be a bit bigger so that other people do not squint their eyes when they trying to read. Although I think I may have exaggerated a bit because the heading for the blogs are quite big but they still look fine nonetheless.
                
                
                <h4>General Reflection</h4>
                I believe that I tried in writing the blog posts, and I put enough information in each. However, I do think I could have more critically engaged with others such as the Tim Berners Lee text. With technical part of the creation, I did well, I used semantic markup where needed, however I did somewhat derail from using semantic markup and ended up using "div”, I did try and cancel out the divs and added semantics on them. headers are visible and there was use of metadata links, I added more metadata links such as the author and saying which languages I used on the website (HTML and CSS). I believe that the structure of the website is simple everything is in eyes view and easy to use.
            </br></br>What I will do differently along this process of creating the website is using GitHub. I lost a lot of code and if I had uploaded to GitHub, I would have been able to retrieve it. I believe what mostly helped me with creating this website was my prior knowledge on html and css as I once took a course that focused on the creation of websites. However, I learnt new things because I was only taught how to create tables insert pictures and links. What I learnt about was the stylesheets. I think stylesheets make easier for a web creator to specify or define the layout of the website whether it be colour, spacing and more. I did however fall into confusion when doing css but I was able to figure it out what I had done wrong

            -	Sticky navigation bar
            As suggested by my markers for Assignment 1, I made the navigation bar stay as the user scrolls to avoid the user to go scroll back to the top of the page to navigate the website. This was not hard to do, I only made the position to be fixed. The only challenge I came across was that I didn’t include the logo to also stay fixed as the user scrolls. However, I was able to fix that, one extra thing I also added was a banner, the main reason for me putting a banner over the navigation bar is so that users easy see and access it. As it will be lightly highlighted.
            Another additional suggestion made was for me to add the same navigation bar on all pages. The first submitted website had a different format of the navigation bar on different pages. The problem with this is that it required the users to go back to the homepage in order to navigation throughout the website. With this change the user will be able to navigate to whichever page they want to view.
            
            -	Bouncing world
            As per my wireframe, the plan was to make a hompage with a bouncing image. The image being of the earth. The reason I changed from a plain picture to an animated one is because I felt like the website was to bland with its black and white, and I just wanted to add something interesting within the website. Surprisingly I did not entirelt struggle with animating the image however, there was a bit of a struggle when it came to the sizing of the image. Also another thing that took time for me to figure out, was how to not make the text surrounding the image not to also bounce. I solved this by moving the image to different section so that it does not interfere with the rest of the text on the homepage.
            
            -	Screen resolution
            On my previous website I did not make the website to fit all screen sizes. However I did try change that but I had challenges along the way. I followed the tutorials but it just wasn’t working. I then went to Youtube for some help but the screen would not cater to smaller sizes. I spent quite some time trying to figure what I may have done wrong.
