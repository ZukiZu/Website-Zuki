                <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p> 
                The first two weeks of the process I was a bit ambiguous. The main idea I wanted was having an animated background for my homepage. I was able to input the animated background but could not put text over the background. I asked for help and Andre advised that I use “z-index” ; z-index is used to specify the order of the element. What I then did was put a z-index of -1 on the image in order for it to go behind the text. However, I later on changed my mind on having an animated background.
            </br></br>As I was going through the tutorials on Ulwazi, in one of them it how to insert an icon on your website. An icon is a symbol that is put in web browsers on the tab of the website. For some reason I thought it was cool, it was just exciting to learn how to create a website from scratch.
            </br></br> I somewhat feel like with the way the code is structured I could have maybe found simpler ways of doing it such as finding another way to add space under text instead of using "br" tags. With the things I did not quite understand I would go to YouTube to better understand. With the blog sections I am not entirely satisfied about them. The information is fine, the problem is the layout of the blog, I could have added pictures or made it more appealing. However, at the moment I think it is fine.
           </br></br>The spacing, font and size of text I chose changed throughout the process. It was a bit difficult to figure out what would be comfortable for other readers. I believe the main reason for that was because I was creating the website from my point of view and not of the readers. So, what I would do is put font and sizing that I am comfortable with reading. Towards the end I realised that I should change the size of the text to be a bit bigger so that other people do not squint their eyes when they trying to read. Although I think I may have exaggerated a bit because the heading for the blogs are quite big but they still look fine nonetheless.
                
                
                <h4>General Reflection</h4>
                I believe that I tried in writing the blog posts, and I put enough information in each. However, I do think I could have more critically engaged with others such as the Tim Berners Lee text. With technical part of the creation, I did well, I used semantic markup where needed, however I did somewhat derail from using semantic markup and ended up using "div”, I did try and cancel out the divs and added semantics on them. headers are visible and there was use of metadata links, I added more metadata links such as the author and saying which languages I used on the website (HTML and CSS). I believe that the structure of the website is simple everything is in eyes view and easy to use.
            </br></br>What I will do differently along this process of creating the website is using GitHub. I lost a lot of code and if I had uploaded to GitHub, I would have been able to retrieve it. I believe what mostly helped me with creating this website was my prior knowledge on html and css as I once took a course that focused on the creation of websites. However, I learnt new things because I was only taught how to create tables insert pictures and links. What I learnt about was the stylesheets. I think stylesheets make easier for a web creator to specify or define the layout of the website whether it be colour, spacing and more. I did however fall into confusion when doing css but I was able to figure it out what I had done wrong
