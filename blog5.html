            <h4>What is a browser? How do they work?</h4>
                The word browse means to scan or skim. On a computer browse would mean scanning through the internet. A browser is a software application that allows users to surf through the World Wide Web a browser basically extracts information from the World Wide Web. Most people can get confused between a browser and a search again. A search engine is a tool that allows users to search and find information in the WWW. Examples of search engines is Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and many others. A browser simply allows a user access to the internet.
                
            <h4>Types of browsers</h4>
                According to research Google chrome is the most used web browser because of its simplicity. When one opens Chrome, they are shown a plain white background with the Google logo and a search bar which is the Google search engine. Chrome is also known as the fastest browser, as it opens pages very quickly even pages that contain heavy pages with many graphics and ads. Google Chrome rules the browser market with just 63.663% which is followed by Safari with 19.37%. Because of the commonly used web browser known as Chrome people have forgotten about other web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Opera, Mozilla Firefox, Safari and others.
                
            <h4>How do web browsers work?</h4>
                So, a web browser has components that play a role in the functionality of it. The first component is the user interface, the interface is where a user interacts with a browser, it includes an address bar and on-screen controls (back, forward, home, bookmarks button, refresh and other options. The second and third components is the browser and rendering engine. The browser engine provides the link between the rendering engine and the user interface. The rendering engine provides the requested web page on the web browser screen (a web page is a document written in HTML) The engine commonly deals with XML and HTML documents to generate the displayed layout in the user interface. Google Chrome uses Blink as a rendering engine. The other components of a web browser include networking (handles the security and internet communication, JavaScript interpreter (interprets and executes the JavaScript code that is embedded in a website), UI backend (draws basic widgets such as the input or select box) and data storage (a uniform layer used to store data such a Cookies).
