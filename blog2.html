                <h1>History of Web Robots</h1>
            <p> 
               <h4>What is a Web Robot?</h4>
               A web robot is also known as internet bot or bot. A bot is a software application whose purpose is to perform tasks on the internet. The tasks they perform are simple and repetitive and they perform the task at a much faster rate than a human being. The many tasks’ bots can handle include but are not limited to web spidering in which information is fetched, analysed and filed, bots can be used as gaming bots, auction bots or commercial bots and chat bots or social networking bots.
               <h4>Malicious uses of bots</h4>
               Unfortunately the internet is now full of hackers and cybercriminals, what these entities do is commit malicious activities with the intention to steal personal information, theft of corporate data and by means of generating profit. When it comes to web robots these entities use unwanted ads in order to exploit a user’s computer. Some common types of bots include but not limited to: 
               <ul>
                   <li>malware bots</li>
                   <li>botnets</li>
                   <li>click bots</li>
                   <li>email spambots</li>
                   <li>DDos attacks</li>
                   <li>cheating game bots</li>
               </ul>
              
               <h4>A brief history on web robots</h4>
               The oldest web robots are said to be traced back from the 1980s, mainly because of the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) which is a text bases chat system used for instant messaging. With IRC emerging the bots that were first used on it were Greg Lindahls’s Game Manager, and Jyrki Alakuijala”s Puppe. These IRC bots mainly sat in channels in order for the server to not close down due to inactivity.

            </br></br></br>The first bots for the first search engines were web crawlers. The first bot to be used was WebCrawler which was used to index web pages. WebCrawler was created in 1994 however it was used in 1995 by AOL and later on bought by Excite in 1997. Googlebot is said to be one of the most popular web crawlers, it was created in 1996 however it was first named BackRub.
                 
            <h4>How have they shaped the present and future</h4>
            As mentioned, web robots perform tasks better and faster than humans and also cheaper. The internet is as advanced as it is today because of web robots, they can simply allow us to search for information by finding useful information through thousands of web pages in seconds. Web robots can also help doctors to diagnose their patients by storing and transcribe information. Also, in the coming years the IT industry will try to come up with better and smarter ways to differentiate bots from humans. This is why when a person is on a website, they are usually asked whether they are a human or a bot.
