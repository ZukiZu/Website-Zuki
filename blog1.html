                <h1>The World-Wide Web</h1>
            
            <p> 
                Tim Berners-Lee is a computer scientist that invented the World-Wide Web in 1993. The World-Wide Web was invented to be a pool of human knowledge where people could share their ideas and knowledge to other collaborators. Donald Norman said that technologies do not have to be the best but must be good enough the text then adds and says that a technology which is inferior can dominate through the factors of availability and or price. If we apply this to Facebook, Facebook was not available to everyone at first it was limited to university students but as soon as they changed the availability to most countries and the age restriction (13+), Facebook began to dominate on the internet. The power of the Web is greater as it was in the beginning, people have access to all kinds of information from around the world, people can also collaborate using videoconferences and games such as chess can be played with an opponent across the world. According to research after 3 decades of the web’s existence still half of the world’s population does not have access. I’m imagining how much information and ideas that population can share to the world and how much more the web could have evolved. I believe that rather than only focusing on how greater the web can be the focus should be on how to minimise the digital divide that is now present.
            </br> </br> As much as the text points out how the web is an endless pool of human knowledge that allows people to learn and explore it does not point out how the said pool or sea of human knowledge can be weaponised. The web can be weaponised through misinformation and theft of personal information.
        </br> </br> W3 (World-Wide Wed) can be distinguished by the idea of unlimited information, by the address system (URL), network protocol (HTTP) and a markup language (HTML). The reading enlightens us on what makes www starting with URLs which are Universal Resource Identifiers which is used as an address. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used to transfer information (plain-text, hypertext, images, etc). HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a language used to create webpages. It was interesting to read about the architecture of the web.
    </br></br> Berner-Lee also talks about the future of W3. He states that he looks forward into seeing developments such as teleconferencing, virtual reality and charging through commercial use. Today we can see how teleconferencing has also expanded to videoconferencing also people can purchase products on the internet. The way web technology has evolved from 1994 shows how the web is yet to evolve in the next coming years/decades.
